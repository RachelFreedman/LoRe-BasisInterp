"""Concept registry for the pairwise LLM judge.

Edit this file to change what the judge scores. Every concept becomes one column
in the output CSV. Definitions are shown verbatim to the judge, so word them the
way you want the model to interpret them.

Bump CONCEPT_SET_VERSION whenever you change CONCEPTS (or edit a definition): it
participates in the cache key, so bumping it invalidates stale cached judgments.
